//! # Proof of True Parallelism
//!
//! This example demonstrates that dagx provides genuine parallel execution
//! by running 10,000 tasks that each sleep for 1 second, completing in ~1 second
//! total instead of 10,000 seconds.
//!
//! ## What You'll Learn
//! - How to verify true parallel execution
//! - The difference between concurrency and parallelism
//! - How dagx scales to thousands of parallel tasks
//! - Performance characteristics of parallel execution
//!
//! ## The Proof
//!
//! If tasks ran sequentially:
//! - 10,000 tasks × 1 second each = 10,000 seconds (2.78 hours)
//!
//! With true parallelism:
//! - All 10,000 tasks run simultaneously = ~1 second total
//!
//! This dramatic difference (10,000x speedup) proves that tasks execute in
//! parallel across multiple threads, not sequentially.
//!
//! ## Key Concepts
//!
//! **Concurrency** - Multiple tasks making progress, but not necessarily at the same time
//! **Parallelism** - Multiple tasks executing simultaneously on different CPU cores
//!
//! This example proves dagx provides true parallelism.
//!
//! ## Running This Example
//! ```bash
//! cargo run --example parallelism_proof --release
//! ```
//!
//! ## Expected Output
//! ```text
//! === Parallelism Proof ===
//!
//! Launching 10,000 tasks that each sleep for 1 second...
//!
//! Result: 10,000 tasks × 1s sleep completed in ~1.2s
//!
//! Proof: If tasks ran sequentially, this would take 10,000 seconds (2.78 hours).
//!        Actual time: 1.2s
//!        Speedup: 8333x
//!        This proves TRUE PARALLEL EXECUTION!
